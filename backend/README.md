# HACKABULL 2023
This is the test repo for HACKABULL 2023

We are making a website that allows the user to chat anonymously with other users. 

We will use socket.io to create a chat room. The way 2 users can chat with each other is by creating a room and then use random matching algorithm to match them with another user. The technology for getting 2 users into a room is socket.io.
